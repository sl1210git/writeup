The EMIR Refit (European Market Infrastructure Regulation) was introduced by the European Union to provide a more robust framework for derivative transactions, central counterparties (CCPs), and trade repositories. 
It is intended to increase transparency and reduce risks associated with the derivatives market.

As of the last cutoff, the EMIR regulations themselves have several key components, including:
* 		Reporting obligations: All derivative contracts must be reported to trade repositories. This includes details such as the counterparties involved, the price, and the maturity of the contracts.
* 		Clearing obligations: Certain standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts must be cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). This requirement is intended to reduce counterparty credit risk.
* 		Risk-mitigation techniques: For OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a CCP, counterparties must apply certain risk-management techniques. This includes the timely confirmation of the terms of contracts, portfolio reconciliation and compression, and the exchange of collateral.
* 		CCP requirements: CCPs are required to maintain certain operational and risk-management standards, and are subject to regulatory oversight.
* 		Trade repository requirements: Trade repositories are required to maintain certain operational standards, and are subject to regulatory oversight.
It's recommended to consult the most recent legal texts or regulatory guidance to get an updated and precise outline of the EMIR Refit requirements, as they might have evolved since my last update.


The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) Refit is a regulatory framework that amends certain provisions of the original EMIR regulation. EMIR Refit introduces several changes to the reporting requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions. 
While I can provide an overview of the data requirements under EMIR Refit, please note that the specific details and reporting obligations may vary depending on the entities involved and the nature of the transactions. It is advisable to consult the official regulations and seek professional advice for accurate and up-to-date information.
Under EMIR Refit, the following data requirements are typically applicable for reporting OTC derivative transactions:
* 		Unique Trade Identifier (UTI): Each derivative transaction must have a unique UTI assigned by the trade repository where it is reported. The UTI helps in identifying and tracking individual transactions.
* 		Counterparty data: Information about the counterparties involved in the transaction is required, including their Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) or another form of unique identification, name, and address.
* 		Product data: Details about the derivative instrument being traded, including the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) or other product identifiers, product name, and product classification.
* 		Transaction data: This includes the trade date, valuation date, notional amount, currency, price, quantity, and any other relevant information specific to the transaction.
* 		Clearing data: If the transaction is cleared through a central counterparty (CCP), data related to the CCP, clearing member, and clearing house must be provided.
* 		Valuation and collateral data: Information about the valuation of the derivative and any collateral exchanged between the counterparties.
* 		Life cycle events: Reporting requirements extend beyond the initial trade and include any subsequent modifications, terminations, and novations of the derivative contracts.
It is important to note that the exact data fields and reporting formats may vary based on the type of counterparty (financial or non-financial) and the specific reporting obligations applicable to each entity.
The reporting of derivative transactions under EMIR Refit is typically done to a trade repository registered with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) or a third-country repository with an equivalence decision from ESMA.
