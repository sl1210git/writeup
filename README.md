How has your work been going this week?

What are you working on today?

Tell me about those production issues we had last week.

Do you think that we’re measuring our uptime well enough?

How are you feeling about our deadline in June?

How best could we ensure that we’ve got all of the right metrics being logged ahead of time?

Ideas for topics of conversation
If you have a particularly quiet direct report or if you’re just looking to mix up the material a bit, here’s a whole bunch of example topics that you’re welcome to use.

Architecture deep dives: At irregular intervals, I find it fun to ask my direct report to take me through the latest architecture of some part of the system that we’re working on. I ask questions about various parts in terms of speed, resilience, redundancy, and so on. Sometimes, this highlights some weak points, but mostly I get a chance to better understand the work and the part of the infrastructure it belongs to.

Process deep dives: You can ask how many steps it takes to get something done, such as releasing code to production and why. Then, you can inquire if and how those steps can be reduced or if any processes be removed completely.

A relevant article you’ve read: I typically read a bunch of technology sites, such as Hacker News. If there’s something interesting I’ve seen, either as a subject or as an open-source project, I’ll talk about it. We can discuss what we’re doing in that area, if anything, and try to pick it apart. You’ll find these discussions always find their way back to what you’re working on.

Teaching: Once you’ve finished this course, you’ll have a whole host of topics to talk through with your direct reports. If you share them, they’ll be able to see more of the world through your eyes. For example, you can discuss delegation and how they could factor it into how they share work with less senior staff so they can learn new skills?

The department or company direction: Ask them what they think about where the company is headed. Do they feel confident in where the company is going, or do they have reservations? If so, why is that? Is there anything that you could do to help?

Collecting feedback: You can ask them if anyone on the team has been particularly helpful recently. Gathering this and then delivering it to that person is a simple task, but it can make people feel appreciated.

Sharing a task you’re working on: People are always interested in what their managers are working on, so why not go through it together? Are you writing a job description, discussing the roadmap with your Product Manager, or working on some code of your own? Open the lid on the box and get their opinions. They’ll appreciate your sharing and will often have some valuable input.

An individual’s impact can be observed subjectively through traits such as the following:
The software that they write: Are they solving problems efficiently with code in a way that is simple, elegant, and extensible?
Their net contribution: Do they predominantly progress independently, setting the standard for others to follow, or do they need a lot of support from others to get their tasks done?
Their collaboration with others: Are they team players that understand the needs, and sometimes contradictory forces within the team and find a way forward.
Their mentorship skills: Are they natural mentors who less-experienced engineers routinely ask for help and who improve their own skills by working with them?
Their influence on other engineers: Do they bring approaches to the table that others follow? Do they advise others outside of their own team on what we should build and how?
Their innovative ideas: Are they suggesting new ways to use technology to enable new features, improve software speed, or reduce the cost of our software?
Their influence on the bottom line of the business: Are they involved in solving problems in new and efficient ways that make other engineers faster (for example, by building reusable architecture) or the product cheaper (for example, by rearchitecting an existing system)?
